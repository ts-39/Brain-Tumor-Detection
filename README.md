## Overview
This project is my first attempt at building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for brain tumor detection. While the code is straightforward, my focus was on learning and applying foundational concepts of CNNs rather than achieving professional-grade complexity. Throughout this project, I deepened my understanding of CNNs, data preprocessing, and the challenges that come with real-world applications of image processing in healthcare.

## Motivation
As a Data Science major student with a growing interest in machine learning and computer vision, this project allowed me to apply what I've been learning in a meaningful way. I wanted to explore how CNNs can help identify brain tumors using MRI images. Although my coding here might be simple, I learned a lot about CNN architectures, layers, and the importance of hyperparameter tuning.

## Installation
To run this project, you’ll need:
- Python 3.7 or above
- Essential libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and Pandas (other requirements are in `requirements.txt`)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run `main.py` to train and test the model on the provided dataset.

## Future Plans
As I continue to develop my skills, I plan to improve this project by experimenting with different CNN architectures, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and possibly adding features like data augmentation or transfer learning.

## Acknowledgments
This project was a significant learning experience for me, and I’d like to thank the online ML community for the numerous resources that helped guide me.
